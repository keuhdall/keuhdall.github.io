Hi! I'm Léonard, a passionate software engineer with expertise in building 
scalable, robust, and efficient server-side applications.

With years of experience in the industry, I specialized in:
• Microservices architecture and containerization
• Cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices
• Observability and system monitoring

I'm passionate about functional programming, clean code, best practices, and beautiful engineering overall.
Aside from the nerdy stuff, I'm also passionate about rock climbing, my maximum grade being 7b+ atm.
I also love reading, watching movies in my couch with a blanket on my lap, architecture, music (Jazz especially).
Here's some recomendations if you feel like listening to those:
• Masaru Imada Trio – Green Caterpillar
• Gerry Mulligan - Night Lights
• Casiopea - Mint Jams
